Researched on the real-time end-to-end convolutional neural network (CNN) StereoNet which can produce depth map. Wrote a report after analyzing StereoNet.

Researched on and write a paper about comparing three optical flow estimate method using CNN: FlowNet2, PWC-Net, GeoNet.

Optimized the neural networks mentioned above to generate optical flow diagram using Jetson TX2 at 20~30 frames per second. Wrote a progress report.
